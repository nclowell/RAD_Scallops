#### Purpose

The shellfish growing community is developing culturing techniques to grow the purple-hinged rock scallop. The rock scallop is a native along the west coast of North America, from Alaska to Baja California, and thus potential rock scallop farms may overlap with the natural range of the species. When farmed scallops spawn in the same seawater as wild scallops, they may interbreed. Interbreeding between hatchery-produced and wild individuals poses genetic risks to populations: it can cause loss of fitness due to domestication selection, loss of genetic diversity within a population, and loss of genetic diversity between populations. Therefore, it is important to consider the genetic variation and population structure of the rock scallop to best inform native shellfish aquaculture management to minimize genetic risks to wild populations.
