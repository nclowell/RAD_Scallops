    "This shouldn't be possible! I double-checked that I used the output of ``pstacks`` (and not back to ``ustacks``) for the second round of ``Stacks`` with my reference genome, but couldn't find the error. One thing that it could be is when I ran ``cstacks`` the second time, I used a ``-g`` and an ``-n`` value, which I found out from Dan may confuse the program. It's supposed to receive either/or, depending on whether using a reference genome. Second round of ``cstacks`` - my catalog had 27,460 loci, second round of ``populations`` - my Genepop file had 82,265 loci.\n",
