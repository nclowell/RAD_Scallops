    "I sequenced four scallops twice in the lane with unique barcodes so that I could quantify genotyping error. I calculated genotyping error by counting the number of genotypes between replicates that did not perfectly match, excluding replicates where either had missing data. Thus, a genotyping error includes both a one allele match and neither allele match (e.g., 0102 & 0202 would be genotyping error with one allele match, and 0202 & 0303 would be neither allele match).\n",

    "\n",
    "To produce a SNP level DAPC, I used the Genepop file that ``population`` outputs at the end of the second round of Stacks. This is after I've made a \"reference genome\" by ultra-filtering a catalog of de novo loci. I then filtered for missing values, filtering out out any loci where the frequency of missing values within any population exceeded .2 (retained 86.5% of loci). Then, I filtered for a minor allele frequency of .05 across populations (retained 21.1% of loci). In the future, I'll write a script that can filter for minor allele frequency based on population allele frequencies, but I didn't have time, and figured it would be a useful preliminary look to filter across populations given that my population sizes are pretty small and even. After these two filtering stages, I retained **15,079 loci**.\n",

    "To produce a haplotype level DAPC, I first had to produce a haplotype Genepop, which is not an output of any step in the Stacks pipeline. I used the ``populations`` haplotypes file output and wrote a script that builds a Genepop file. Then, I filtered for missing values, using again a threshold of .2 to remove any locus where in any population the missing value frequency exceeded .2 (retained 68.1% of loci). Then, I tried to filter for a low minor allele frequency, but it kept filtering out pretty much all of my data. So, I plotted a histogram of haplotype frequencies, to try and see how common different frequencies were. This means I plotted the frequencies of each haplotype across individuals. And this is what it looked like:\n",

    "No surprise almost everything was getting filtered out with a minor allele frequency threshold of .03 and .05. So, I skipped the minor allele frequency filtering because it didn't make any sense with this data. With just filtering for missing data, I retained **5,282 loci**.
