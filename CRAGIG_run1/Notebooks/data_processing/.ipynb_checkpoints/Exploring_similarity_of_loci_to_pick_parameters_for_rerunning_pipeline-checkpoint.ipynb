    "Last week, I made a bunch of exploratory plots to understand my data, and it led me to align my catalog loci to each other in search of paralogous loci/oversplitting loci. And from a preliminary visual assessment, it looks like I did oversplit. I wanted to take some time now to figure out how clustering at different levels of similarity affects the outcome number of loci and how much I believe those loci are clustered correctly (aka, allowing more mismatches in Stacks, or clustering with other software completely like Swarm or mothur).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thought is that I should probably look at what sequences I lost during the Bowtie and Blast filtering steps, because I lost most of my loci (~90%), and maybe there are clues in there as to what I should do next.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, yet another thought is I should see what happens when I retry the Bowtie and BLAST filtering using bowtie 2 because it allows for gaps in alignments. It seems like I should switch over to it anyway now that I know there are plenty of indels in mydata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's one tiny piece of an alignment I made of the loci that were kept after bowtie filtering (lost 88% of loci after bowtie filtering):\n",

    "Notice reading the sequences from the left, that stick out a bit, how similar those ~10 sequences are. That's terrifying!"
