## Drivers of population differentiation

I looked for evidence of isolation by distance, among all loci, putatively neutral loci, and putatively adaptive loci using this [script](https://github.com/nclowell/SeaCukes/blob/master/5_potential_drivers_of_differentiation/isolation_by_distance.R).

I also investigated biological functions associated with putatively adaptive SNPs to develop hypotheses of selection driving population differentiation. I used the ``UniProt Knowledge Base`` to create a ``blastx`` database, and retrieved GO Slim terms for hits (cript [here]()).

I used DAPC and PCA on putatively neutral versus putatively adaptive loci to look at potential differences in clustering patterns ([script here](https://github.com/nclowell/RAD_scallops/blob/master/3_pop_structure_analyses/PCA_DAPC.R).
